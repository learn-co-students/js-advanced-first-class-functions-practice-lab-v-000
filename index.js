//use the sort function along with the localeCompare method to alphabetically sort the name attribute regardless of upper/lowercase

        //   function (totalAggregate, currentDriver)
            return agg + el.revenue
      }, 0);
}

//takes in a collection of drivers
//pass on the reduce function which takes 2 arguments, a callback function and where you would like the reduce to begin
//the callback function is defined with 4 arguments, aggregeate total, element being iterated on, index of element, and the entire array

const averageRevenue = function (drivers){
    return totalRevenue(drivers) / drivers.length;
}

//averageRevenue() â€” Receives an array of driver objects and returns the average revenue earned by each driver.
